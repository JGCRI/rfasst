The first function of the package is `m1_emissions_rescale`. It re-scales emissions from GCAM regions to TM5-FASST regions which is the purpose of Module 1.

The function processes emissions outputs from GCAM to make them match with the regional disaggregation of TM5-FASST. Concretely, GCAM emissions are downscaled to country level, using a static downscaling approach based on the pollutant-specific country-level emissions in year 2000 reported in the [RCP database](https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome). This approach is planned to be revised in the future, for example with the implementation a dynamic GDP-based downscaling procedure linked with the scenario-specific socioeconomic data in GCAM. 

Apart from the regional adjustments, this function makes some additional pollutant-related changes such as the transformation of organic carbon into organic matter.

Inputs:

* NonCO2 emissions by sector: By default, they will be automatically queried from the GCAM-database
* NonCO2 emissions from international aviation and international shipping: By default, queried from the GCAM database.
* Mapping of pollutants that are reported by GCAM to more aggregated categories which are input in TM5-FASST (my_pol)
* Mapping of GCAM regions to countries and ISO3 codes for downscaling GCAM results to country-level (GCAM_Reg_Adj)
* Mapping of TM5-FASST regions to ISO3 country codes for re-grouping country-level downscaled emissions (fasst_reg)
* Shares to distribute emissions of different species between Russia Eastern (RUE) and Western (RUS) (adj_rus)

Outputs:

The function produces re-scaled emissions of the main pollutants for each period and TM5-FASST region. If `saveOutput` is set to `TRUE`, the function writes the following csv files in the `output/m1` sub-directory: `[scenario]_[year].csv`

In addition, by setting `map`to `TRUE`, the function generates air pollutant emission maps by year and specie, using the [rmap](https://github.com/JGCRI/rmap) package documented in the following [page](jgcri.github.io/rmap/)

The outputs from this module generated with the function `m1_emissions_rescale` are going to read by the set of functions in Module 2, which calculate  PM2.5 and O3 average concentration levels based on these emission sets.
