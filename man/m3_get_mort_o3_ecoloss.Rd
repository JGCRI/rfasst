Economic damages associated with mortality attributable to O3 (M6M) exposure for each TM5-FASST regions for all years
}
\description{
Produce economic damages associated with premature mortality attributable to O3 (M6M) exposure based on the IER functions from Jerret et al (2009), consistent with the GBD 2016 study. The economic valuation takes as a base value the widely accepted Value of Statistical Life (VSL) of the OECD for 2005. This value, according to the literature ranges between US$1.8 and $4.5 million. The calculations for all regions are based on the  “unit value transfer approach” which adjusts the VSL according to their GDP and GDP growth rates. (Markandya et al 2018)
