Economic damages associated with YLLs attributable to PM2.5 exposure for each TM5-FASST regions for all years (Thous$2015).The list of countries that form each region and the full name of the region can be found in Table S2.2 in the TM5-FASST documentation paper: Van Dingenen, R., Dentener, F., Crippa, M., Leitao, J., Marmer, E., Rao, S., Solazzo, E. and Valentini, L., 2018.

\description{
Produce Economic damages associated with YLLs attributable to PM2.5.The economic valuation takes as a base value the Value of Statistical Life Year (VSLY) for EU from Schlander et al (2017) and expands the value to other regions based on the“unit value transfer approach” which adjusts the VSLY according to their GDP and GDP growth rates. . .YLL-to-Mortalities ratios are based on TM5-FASST calculations. Premature mortalities are  based on the integrated exposure-response functions (IER) from Burnett et al (2014), consistent with the GBD 2016 study.
