Economic damages associated with mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure for each TM5-FASST regions for all years (Million$2015). The list of countries that form each region and the full name of the region can be found in Table S2.2 in the TM5-FASST documentation paper: Van Dingenen, R., Dentener, F., Crippa, M., Leitao, J., Marmer, E., Rao, S., Solazzo, E. and Valentini, L., 2018.

\description{
Produce economic damages associated with premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure based on the IER functions from Burnett et al (2014), consistent with the GBD 2016 study. The economic valuation takes as a base value the widely accepted Value of Statistical Life (VSL) of the OECD for 2005. This value, according to the literature ranges between US$1.8 and $4.5 million. The calculations for all regions are based on the  “unit value transfer approach” which adjusts the VSL according to their GDP and GDP growth rates. (Markandya et al 2018)
